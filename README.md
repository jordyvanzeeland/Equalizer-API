# Passqualizer API.

Passqualizer is a password manager where projects can be managed and passwords for Database, FTP and Wordpress passwords can be stored. Also there's a section where passwords can be stored for websites to login to, f.e. Themeforest or Facebook. 

## API Features
- The API is build with Laravel. Recently it has been updated to version 10 with compatibility for PHP 8. 
- For the authentication of the API I use JSON Web Token (JWT). Therefor I use Tymon/JWTAuth for it: https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth
